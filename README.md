# 🧁Sunrise-Bakery

## 🍰Overview: <br/>
Our project’s objective aims to develop a bakery system. The main advantage of this system is to be easy, direct and efficient at the same time. Anyone that enters the bakery must choose if she/he is an admin or a user, such options will appear for both, the whole system will be organized so the customers data won’t be lost or discarded.

## 🎯Our Objectives:<br/>
* Customers can order as much as they like from bread, dessert and drinks, each with its own category. Also they can view their cart and print the bill.
* Admins will be able to display, add and remove items from the bakery system.
* The system will display the calories with each item added, along with its unique characteristics. For example, when choosing bread the customer will know if it’s brown or white.

### General Interface:
That’s the first interface that will appear, you will choose if you’re an admin or a costumer.

### Admin’s Interface:
If you chose admin option, the first thing you must enter is username and password to secure the bakery’s products. If you entered them wrong an “invalid Username & password” message will appear otherwise, you will choose from the admin’s option menu.

### Customer Interface :
if you chose the costumer option this interface will appear. You can add products to the cart, view your cart and print the bill.
